=head1 SPECIFICATION

This document describes how transactional functions should work. A transactional
function is function which can be involved in a Riap transaction (see
L<Riap::Transaction> for more details).

The majority of transactional capability is provided by a transaction manager
(TM). Everytime function wants to perform something (a step) it should record
the undo step first in the transaction manager. This way, undo/rollback/rollback
recovery can be performed when needed.

Function should also always use resource managers (RM) provided by the TM, like
database, transactional filesystem, etc. But it is currently the responsibility
of the function to modify resources while keeping transaction ACID properties.
