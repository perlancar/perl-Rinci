=item * Why do you make enveloped result an arary instead of hash?

For example, a hash-based enveloped result can be something like:

 {status=>200, message=>"OK", result=>42, meta1=>..., meta2=>...}

This has the benefit of a single container, but I picked array because of the
brevity for simple cases (which are the majority), e.g.:

 [200]        # versus {status=>200}
 [200, "OK"]  # versus {status=>200, message=>"OK"}

When handling enveloped result, the array version is also shorter:

 if ($res->[0] == 200) { ... }
 # versus: if ($res->{status} == 200) { ... }

 print "Error $res->[0] - $res->[1]";
 # versus: print "Error $res->{status} - $res->{message}";

The hash version is more obvious for first-time reader, but after just some
amount of time, C<< $res->[0] >>, C<< $res->[1] >> will become obvious if you
use it consistently.

As a bonus, arrays are faster and more space-efficient than hashes.
