Revision history for Rinci

1.1.0    2012-01-12 (not yet released)

         First release. Spun off from Sub::Spec and Sub::Spec::HTTP.

         Incompatible differences with Sub::Spec 1.0.x:

         + Terminology: 'spec clause' becomes 'property'. This is to avoid
           confusion with 'clause' as used in Sah schema language.

         + 'v' clause is now required to declare Rinci spec version (with value
           1.1, if unspecified then assumed spec is old Sub::Spec 1.0).

         + Md::Func: Incompatible changes to 'args' and 'result' clauses; 'args'
           is now a hash of arg names and arg *specs* (instead of arg schemas).
           'result' is now a hash of data, instead of schema. The purpose is to
           keep Sah schema clean from custom, non-schema-related schema clauses,
           like arg_* (thus requiring custom Sah extensions, etc). Mixing them
           into schemas was not the right way.

         + Md::Func: clause 'type' removed, replaced with 'is_func', 'is_meth',
           'is_static_meth'. This is because a single subroutine/function can
           act as all.

         + Md::Func: Other clauses which are also removed since they are not
           deemed as 'core' at the moment: 'timeout', 'retry', 'scope'.

         + Default text markup format changed from Org to Markdown, but a new
           clause 'text_markup' is added to allow specifying 'org' or
           'markdown'.

         Additions:

         + Keys beginning with "_" are allowed and ignored. This can be used to
           store extra information.

         + New clause 'tags' and 'see'.
